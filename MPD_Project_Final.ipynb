    "## Project: Million Playlist Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## A. Data\n",
    "In this project, you will implement a data processing pipeline for analyzing music playlists. We\n",
    "will use the Million Playlist Dataset published by Spotify, discussed here: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge, and available to download here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himanshuwagh/spotify-million/data.\n",
    "The dataset contains one million playlists, where each playlist contains information about the playlist\n",
    "itself (e.g., playlist title, duration) and each track it contains (e.g., track id, artist id, track name,\n",
    "duration). The dataset was used as part of a “playlist continuation” challenge: given a playlist name\n",
    "and a few tracks, predict which other tracks would fit best with that playlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "## B. Tasks\n",
    "In this project, you are asked to address the following tasks.\n",
    "1. Present your approach to handling this big dataset. Given that the dataset is big, at about 35 GB,\n",
    "you are not expected to be able to process all of it. Ideally, of course, you should have a solution\n",
    "that scales to the whole dataset. Describe the approach you took and all the alternatives you\n",
    "considered.\n",
    "2. Present some interesting statistical/aggregate information about the dataset. Explain how you\n",
    "derived the presented information.\n",
    "3. Propose a definition of similarity between tracks. Specifically, given two tracks, their similarity\n",
    "is a score from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the two tracks are not similar at all, and 1 indicates\n",
    "that the two tracks are identical. Design a method to compute those similarity scores using the\n",
    "dataset. Discuss the implementation and give some examples.\n",
    "4. Propose a definition of similarity (score ranging from 0 to 1) between playlists. Design a method\n",
    "to compute this similarity score using the dataset. Discuss the implementation and give some\n",
    "examples.\n",
    "5. Propose a method to solve the “playlist continuation” challenge. Discuss the implementation\n",
    "and give some examples.\n",
    "You should write the code in Python, and you are free to use the tools and frameworks (e.g., Spark,\n",
    "Dask) that we have discussed in this course as well as others.\n"

    "## Our Approach\n",
    "1. Load the first slice and explore the schema (Task 0 – setup).\n",
    "2. Build a random sampled DataFrame from multiple slices (Task 1).\n",
    "3. Derive analytics on the sampled DataFrame (Task 2).\n",
    "4. Define track similarity: 0.7 Jaccard over co-playlists + 0.3 metadata (artist/album) (Task 3).\n",
    "5. Define playlist similarity: weighted Jaccard with 0.7 tracks + 0.3 artists (Task 4).\n",
    "6. Implement next-track recommendation (Task 5):\n",
    "   - Overlap-only neighbor retrieval (default `N_neighbors = 100`).\n",
    "   - Consensus filter: keep candidates seen in at least 2 neighbors (`min_freq = 2`) with safe fallback.\n",
    "   - Python engine: Phase 1 (playlist scoring) time-bounded; Phase 2 (track ranking) unlimited.\n",
    "   - Spark engine: weighted hybrid reranking `Score = 0.6 * Sim(last_track, cand) + 0.4 * avg_{t∈P} Sim(t, cand)`.\n",
    "7. Evaluate with Hide & Seek:\n",
    "   - Selective engine flags `use_python` / `use_spark` (both True by default).\n",
    "   - Use `display_test_summary(test_result)` to present results consistently.\n",
    "8. Scaling plan: run the Spark engine on the full `complete_df`, compare analytics vs sample, and tune weights if needed."

    "#### Approach: Hybrid Similarity Score\n",
    "To quantify the similarity between two tracks ($t_1, t_2$), we propose a **Weighted Hybrid Score** that combines **User Behavior (Context)** and **Metadata (Content)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Score(t_1, t_2) = \\alpha \\cdot Sim_{context}(t_1, t_2) + (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot Sim_{content}(t_1, t_2) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose $\\alpha = 0.7$ to prioritize user behavior, as co-occurrence in playlists is a stronger signal of \"vibe\" similarity than raw metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Context Similarity (Jaccard Index)\n",
    "We measure how often two tracks appear together in the same playlists relative to their total appearances. This normalizes for popularity (avoiding the \"Drake effect\" where popular tracks co-occur with everything).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ J(t_1, t_2) = \\frac{|P(t_1) \\cap P(t_2)|}{|P(t_1) \\cup P(t_2)|} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $P(t)$ is the set of Playlist IDs containing track $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Content Similarity (Metadata)\n",
    "We use a simple rule-based score to boost tracks that share metadata attributes. This helps with the \"Cold Start\" problem for rare tracks.\n",
    "*   **Same Artist:** +0.5\n",
    "*   **Same Album:** +0.3\n",
    "*   *(Normalized to range 0-1)*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Implementation Strategy\n",
    "Computing $N^2$ pairs is impossible for 2M+ tracks. We use an **Inverted Index** approach:\n",
    "1.  **Build Profiles (`build_track_profiles`):** We aggregate the dataset once to create a global `track_profiles` DataFrame. This acts as a lookup table mapping `Track_URI -> {Set<Playlist_IDs>, Artist_URI, Album_URI}`.\n",
    "2.  **On-Demand Calculation (`calculate_track_score`):** The scoring function takes two Track URIs, retrieves their profiles from the global DataFrame, and computes the score instantly. This keeps the function signature simple and efficient."

    "#### Approach: Two-Stage Hybrid Recommender with Python & Spark Engines\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement a focused, scalable pipeline leveraging the similarity functions from Tasks 3 and 4. Initially, we built a **Python engine** to validate the recommendation logic and ensure correctness. However, we found it was **too slow** when processing large numbers of playlists (neighbor search iterates through playlists one-by-one, triggering repeated Spark jobs). We then built a **Spark engine** using native distributed SQL operations to scale efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipeline (common to both):**\n",
    "1. Neighbor retrieval (overlap-only): find playlists sharing tracks or artists with the target.\n",
    "2. Neighbor scoring: compute weighted Jaccard playlist similarity and keep the top `N_neighbors`.\n",
    "3. Candidate extraction: collect tracks from neighbors not already in the target; apply a consensus filter (keep tracks seen in ≥ 2 neighbors) with a safe fallback if empty.\n",
    "4. Local ranking: score and rank candidates (engine-specific logic).\n",
    "5. Recommendation: return the top-`K` ranked candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Engine Differences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Python Engine | Spark Engine |\n",
    "|--------|---|---|\n",
    "| **Neighbor Search** | Iterates playlists one-by-one; triggers Python ↔ Spark job repeatedly | Native Spark SQL with `array_intersect` & `size`; single distributed query |\n",
    "| **Scoring** | Calls `calculate_playlist_score()` for each neighbor (iterative) | Scores all neighbors in parallel (distributed) |\n",
    "| **Ranking** | Compares candidates **only to last track** (no co-occurrence weighting) | Weighted hybrid: `0.6 * Sim(last_track, cand) + 0.4 * avg_{t∈P} Sim(t, cand)` |\n",
    "| **Time Limit** | Phase 1 (neighbor search) is time-bounded; Phase 2 (ranking) unlimited | No explicit time limit; scales with Spark workers |\n",
    "| **Speed** | Slow for large datasets (O(n) jobs); good for validation only | Fast for large datasets; production-ready |\n",
    "| **Use Case** | Testing & debugging; small samples (M3, ~100K playlists) | Complete dataset evaluation (1M playlists) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Both?**\n",
    "- **Python engine**: Provides interpretable baseline to verify recommendation logic before scaling.\n",
    "- **Spark engine**: Enables production-scale evaluation; Hide & Seek tests can toggle between engines to compare quality vs. speed."

    "\n",
    "**What we tested:**\n",
    "- **Python engine:** Confirmed to be too slow for the full dataset (as seen on M3 sample with 5K+ playlists); excluded from scaling attempts.\n",
    "- **Spark engine:** Attempted as the primary scaling strategy, leveraging distributed computing for faster profile builds and recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we encountered:**\n",
    "The bottleneck occurs **during data loading and profile building**, before we can even test the recommendation engine:\n",
    "- Loading all 1M playlists (66.3M tracks) from JSON slices into `complete_df` succeeds but consumes significant memory.\n",
    "- Building the track and playlist profile indices via `build_track_profiles()` and `build_playlist_profiles()` exhausts available heap space on this local machine.\n",
    "- Without successfully building the profiles, we cannot proceed to test end-to-end recommendations on the full dataset.\n",
